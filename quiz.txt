Weekly quiz
===========

It is expected that you will not have time to answer all questions. Try to answer at least one question from each section. (Questions nearer the top of each section are more important to know.)

Ruby basics
-----------

1) Describe the following ruby objects:
for instance [1,2,3] would be "an array containing three elements, the integer 1, the integer 2 and the integer 3"
and "" would be "a blank string"

1a) :crocodile
-- A symbol

1b) "145.73"
-- A string

1c) { :coffee => "cafe" }
-- a hash, containing a 'key' and a 'value'

1d) [ :green, :eggs, :ham ]
-- an array (of symbols)

1e) ["tea", {"juice" => "orange"}]
-- and array, containing a string and a hash, which is nestes (whish also contains strings)

2) Here is an array:
array = ["Molly", "Greg", "Taz"]
Write a line of ruby that appends the values "Jay" and "Mona" to the array.
-- array << ["Jay", "Mona"]

3) Here is a hash:
hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Baah" }
Write a line of ruby that replaces the value of the key :sheep with "Bleat".
-- 
    hash[sheep] = "bleat"


4) The file number_converter.rb contains a method called convert_number that doesn't do anything.

Replace the #??? comment inside it so that:
  if the argument passed is greater than 5, it returns 3 times the number,
  and if it is less than or equal to 5 it returns the number minus 3.

5) Write a method that takes one argument (an array full of strings) and `puts` each word separately, but in uppercase.

-- in number converter


6) What's the difference between an object and an instance?

-- off the top of my head, no idea, lets google that. 
			apparently, an object of an instance is a class. a class is much like a blueprint, or set of instructions, all things made from that class are objects of it. a singular house is an instance.

			Though I am still unsure of this, much like a house built on a swamp

Testing
-------
7) robot.rb contains a simple class with two methods. robot_spec.rb is the start of a spec file - it runs, but there aren't any tests in it.

-- (it is now 6 o'clock....)

a) Write a test that checks greet('Ada') returns the string "HELLO ADA".
b) Write a test that checks calculate(4, 5) returns 9.
c) Write a test that checks calculate(5, 'horse') returns 5.

8) Explain the difference between the rspec methods let and subject.

HTML, CSS and Javascript
------------------------

8) In a sentance, describe:
a) what is HTML?
 -- Hyper text lanuage markup - a document or where things are ona  page, that is like a living this, as it has a head (all the thinking things) and the body

b) what is CSS?
 -- content style sheet,  on different document, this designs everything on the HTML

c) what is Javascript?
 --  a clever thing that captures moments/events on screen and plays with them, this can create super awesom sites that react to whatever you do to them


9) State if the following lines are HTML, CSS,or Javascript:

a) <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
-- HTML

b) console.log("Some words");
-- Javascript

c) p { background-color: yellow }
-- CSS

d) <table width="50%"></table>
 -- HTML

e) <div id="index" class="small left"></div>
-- HTML RUN OUT OF TIME NOW

10) Describe the following Javascript objects, like you did for the first question:

10a) 100.26

10b) "Hello"

10c) [ "a", 4, null ]

10d) { height: "180cm" }
